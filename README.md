### Review Questions

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
  <br>
  Built using the default architecture from running `npm create vite@latest`
- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  <br>
  - Would make the website Responsive
  - Would implement simple authentication using PHP
- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  <br>
  - Figure out how to add a default image if link of original image was broken, instead of depending on `'onError={(e) => { e.target.alt = " "; }}'` to handle that state
  - Would add responsiveness to the site
